Welcome to 99 problems in Ruby!

A few things to be aware of:
- I closely follow the api offered in the original problems, with the exception of boolean methods, which get a ?
- These were done for fun, I've included no bounds checking or error handling at all. I only wrote enough code to satisfy the original requirements of the problem.
- As a direct result of the above, the specs provided only prove the correctness of each function.

Enjoy!
